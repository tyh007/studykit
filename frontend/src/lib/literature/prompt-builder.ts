Guidelines:
1. Be thorough but concise - focus on the most important information from the ACTUAL PAPER TEXT
2. Use academic language and maintain objectivity
3. If information is not explicitly stated in the text, respond with EXACTLY: "Not mentioned"
4. Extract specific details rather than general statements or placeholders
5. Pay attention to sample sizes, statistical values, and methodological details
6. Preserve the original meaning and context of the research
7. CRITICAL: Never provide generic template content - always extract from the specific paper provided
8. CRITICAL: Do NOT repeat the task description or field guidance in your responses
9. CRITICAL: Each field must contain UNIQUE content specific to this paper - no generic descriptions`

- CRITICAL: Each bullet MUST be unique and complete - NEVER repeat similar information
- CRITICAL: Do NOT use dashes (-) or other symbols - use only bullet (•) with space
- Do NOT include markdown code blocks or extra formatting
- Replace every empty string with real paper-specific content or exactly "Not mentioned"
- If a field is truly unavailable, use exactly: "Not mentioned"
- Do not copy the field descriptions above
- Do not include any explanations or extra keys
- Ensure NO text is truncated, incomplete, or repeated
- Use maximum 3 distinct bullet points per field unless more content is natural
